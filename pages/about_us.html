                            It’s not easy to take on the responsibility of caring for someone. Whether you’ve had time to prepare for it or it’s been unexpected, caregiving can be a major life change for everyone involved, whether you’re friends, family, or neighbors.

                        I’m so glad we found The Helper Bees. You all make this process so easy. Since we have started care with you, I have noticed an improvement in my father's health. The caregivers are feeding him, reminding him to take his Ensure and we couldn't be happier! I can't wait for my mom to start services with you all as well.

                            Beyond the everyday tasks, there may be bigger things to figure out: from helping manage short-term or long-term finances, to estate planning, to unexpected legal questions.

                            Getting your arms around those bigger issues can be tough, especially when you’re already dealing with so much day to day. But that’s why we have Care Advisors: pros who can lighten your load and make things more manageable.

                            And maybe you just need to catch your breath before the next thing. The time you devote to caregiving is valuable. We can help you get some of it back, and feel confident in the big and little caregiving decisions you have to make.
