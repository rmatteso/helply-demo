                                That starts with providing help for the most basic and universal needs: making sure those you’re helping are safe, fed, and getting the health care they need. Then it means recognizing the different and unique needs you have.

                                Maybe you need help finding ride shares for running those errands that pop up every day. Or you could need help finding and installing grab bars or you might need a contractor for bigger projects. It might be as simple as learning about ways to stay active, both for you and those you care for.

                                Beyond the everyday tasks and work, there are also bigger things to figure out, from managing finances in the short or long term to estate planning to unexpected legal questions. Getting your arms around those bigger issues can be tough when you’re already dealing with so much day to day, but that’s why we have [Help Advisors] who can help make it more manageable.

                                And hey: Maybe you just need to take a breath before you get a handle on the next thing. The time you give to care is valuable, and so is your own. We believe you deserve to get some of it back and feel secure in the care decisions you make.

                        I’m so glad we found The Helper Bees. You all make this process so easy. Since we have started care with you, I have noticed an improvement in my father's health. The caregivers are feeding him, reminding him to take his Ensure and we couldn't be happier! I can't wait for my mom to start services with you all as well.

                            The Helper Bees created America’s Aging-in-Place Platform, a sustainable model for aging-in-place that connects millions of families with transformative services in and around their homes.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5">
                            Our technology provides the infrastructure for payers to access, deploy, and scale services into the home. As a result, The Helper Bees partners with some of the world’s largest insurance carriers and health plans.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5">
                            Together we are improving the way in-home care is delivered and enabling older adults to age independently at home.
